CS771A : Introdction to Machine Learning Course Project

Using decision-tree developed a machine learning algorithm that guesses a secret word in minimum number of queries.

How to Run the code:

1) Open the Code_evaluation file in Google Colab
2) Upload dict_secret and submit.py file
3) Run the Colab file
4) You will get the output: Training time, size of code, winnning probability, average number of queries.

Average number of queries for dict_secret input file : 4.08
Winning Probability: 1.0 (or 100%)
